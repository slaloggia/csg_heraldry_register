## Chicago Swordplay Guild Heraldry Register
A gallery of personal heraldry for members of the Chicago Swordplay Guild

### Why
Guild members of Scholar rank and above are encouraged to develop their own
personal heraldry, but until now there was no means of displaying these creations to the public.
Several recent Scholars requested a digital version of the registry in our Guild Book.

### Notes
Members did not want to have to log in to upload their heraldry or view the page, so the goal is to create 
a simple password-protection system for accessing the upload/update form, with the view-only pages freely accessible.
