            <h2>About Personal Heraldry</h2>
                <p>
                Scholars and Free Scholars of the Chicago Swordplay Guild are permitted to create a heraldic shield design, 
                for display within the Guild Book, as part of their advancement to the rank of Scholar or Free Scholar. 
                This heraldic shield must fit within the guidelines of heraldry laid out for advancing Guilders. 
                Once designed by the Scholar, the shield will be illuminated by one of the Guild book artists: Victor Bayona, Erin Fitzgerald, Heather Hilchey, Rebecca Smith. 
                Additionally, those advancing to the rank of Free Scholar or Provost will be allowed to create a full Heraldic Achievement 
                with their Scholar shield advanced to include a motto, supporters, helm, crest, and mantle. 
                Some additional personalized elements will be permitted for the rank of Provost. 
                <br/>
                Students are responsible for researching and selecting the elements of their Coat of Arms. 
                General resources are provided in the Guild Handbook.

            <h3>Scholars</h3>
                <p>
                Upon obtaining the rank of Scholar, a Scholar may fashion a shield of their own design to be memorialized in the Guild Book. 
                This shield must meet heraldic and reproductive standards, for consistency and re-creation. 
                When creating a shield, the Scholar must, at a minimum, choose a field color(s) and a division of the field or Ordinary or Charge. 
                Depending on the complexity desired the shield may include all of the above.<br/>
                The following links provide some generic explanations of the shield and associated elements.

                        Heraldic rules for the above, must be adhered to. Modern objects as charges are not acceptable for the Coat of Arms project.
